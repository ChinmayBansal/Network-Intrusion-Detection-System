# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (AI-NIDS)

üõ°Ô∏è **Machine Learning vs Signature-Based Network Intrusion Detection**

## üéØ Project Overview

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models for network intrusion detection, comparing their performance against traditional signature-based detection systems. The goal is to demonstrate whether ML approaches can outperform conventional rule-based IDS like Snort and Suricata in detecting both known and unknown network attacks.

## üìä Datasets

### Primary Dataset: UNSW-NB15
- **Size**: ~2.5M network flow records
- **Features**: 49 features including protocols, packet sizes, flags, flow statistics
- **Labels**: Normal traffic + 9 attack categories
  - Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits
  - Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, Worms

## üß† Machine Learning Approaches

### Baseline Models
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple linear classifier
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for feature importance analysis

### Advanced Models
- **LightGBM/XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for high performance
- **Autoencoders**: Unsupervised anomaly detection

### Classification Strategies
1. **Binary Classification**: Normal vs Attack (higher accuracy)
2. **Multi-class Classification**: Specific attack categories (more realistic)

## üìë Case Study: ML vs Signature-Based Detection

### Problem Statement
Traditional signature-based IDS systems like Snort and Suricata rely on predefined rules and patterns, making them ineffective against:
- Zero-day attacks
- Polymorphic malware  
- Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Encrypted malicious traffic

### Hypothesis
Machine learning models can achieve better detection rates by:
- Learning complex patterns from network flow statistics
- Adapting to new attack variants
- Reducing false positive rates
- Detecting anomalous behavior without explicit rules

### Evaluation Methodology
1. **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
2. **Model Comparison**: ML models vs simulated signature-based detection
3. **Analysis**: Feature importance, confusion matrices, error analysis
4. **Real-world Applicability**: Deployment considerations and limitations
